username and nickname controll
IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
do we want to normalize?

# Create 50+ simultaneous connections
for i in {1..50}; do
    (echo -e "PASS password123\nNICK user$i\nUSER user$i 0 * :User $i\nJOIN #stress\nPRIVMSG #stress :Hello from user$i" | nc localhost 6667) &
done
wait

So far I tested:
- malformed messages ( test_malformed.sh file and manual testing)
- buffer limits/long line > 510
- incomplete messages (fix with incomplete user message - it was accepting and sending welcome message without the real name after colon)
- registration, buffer limits, basic channel ops
- if the nickname isn't set and is empty, it is not shown, which is according to the protocol
- fixed duplicate JOIN and other messages
- 366 END OF NAMES goes only to the joiner fixed

Dasha:
- mode #chan +l 0 - set to return an error. + added overflowcheck. only numbers from 1 to INT_MAX are acceptable
